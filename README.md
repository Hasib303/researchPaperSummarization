# Fine-tune LLM for Research Paper Summarization

This project is for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to summarize research papers efficiently.

## Features

- Fine-tune language models
- Summarize research papers

# Workflow

- Fine tuning an llm model for research paper summarization task 
- The long-t5-tglobal-base model is used to fine tune
- For the data, from ccdv/arxiv-summarization dataset, 1000 records are used.
